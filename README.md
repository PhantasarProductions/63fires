# Notes

In this form this project is discontinued and canceled.
I hope I can plan things well to re-create this game for SCI, but then things will be roughly redone from scratch. This *is* after all a LÖVE2D project and I've grown to hate that engine (and its community to be frank). Now SCI does support pure lua code, but I prefer to get things converted anyway and SCI approaches many things differently than Löve2D does. So one way or another, this project will either end in this form, regardless if it's redone in another form.

So this repository will now be archived and over time it will even be moved to my personal graveyard.


# Sixty-Three Fires of Lung


===

This will be the repository for the RPG game "Sixty-Three Fires of Lung". 
This is a parody game to many games, but still one with a serious challenging RPG gameplay.
As more information can be given, I may put it on this repository.

You can follow the live development log [here](http://tricky.gamejolt.io/63fires)

===

Also note a few things. This game has been written for Love -> http://love2d.org
However dumping these files together in a love file using "zip" or any similar tool will get you nowhere at all. 
First of all the assets are missing, these are only the script files.
Second, these files are also set up to be built with the [Ryanna builder](https://github.com/TrickyGameTools/Ryanna). Ryanna automatically builds in a lua preprocessor giving all kinds of neat features that Love does not provide on its own. The "63.rpf" file is the project file Ryanna uses to create one big game out of this. Also Ryanna is able to automatically add libraries to the game, so I can keep my working directory clean, and I always have the latest versions merged in. :P

Once the game can be released in either demo form or full game form, the download links will be shown here. ;)
