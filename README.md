# Sixty-Three Fires of Lung


This reposity is at the present time only a placeholder.
Some tools I am now configuring need to refer to it... for the time being.
If this project ever starts (as that has not yet been decided), this repository will be used for that, and then this readme will contain the proper information too.



===

This will be the repository for the RPG game "Sixty-Three Fires of Lung". 
This is a parody game to many games, but still one with a serious challenging RPG gameplay.
As more information can be given, I may put it on this repository.
