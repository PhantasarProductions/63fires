# headers.h

The name of this library is a pun to the large collection of .h files ever C programmer hates.
It's very unsatisfying work to create these files just for the sake of code cleanness and good interfacing of your libraries.

Now this library is not exactly the same but also hated a bit.
The game is a bit written with the 'load on demand' idea in mind. This being said things would go quicker to have a command ready to which immediately loads the required library when it's needed for the first time.
And that is basically what all functions here do.

Nice work to set these files up? Definitely not!
But saving me a lot of trouble later? Definitely yes!
And that's why I still need this.
